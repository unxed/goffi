package dl

// When CGO_ENABLED=1, drag in runtime/cgo so that the Go runtime properly
// initializes its cgo machinery. The dl wrappers below use runtime.cgocall
// (via //go:linkname) which only works when iscgo is true; runtime/cgo's
// init is what flips that flag.
//
// Some frameworks also need TLS to be set up the C way, which Go does not
// do unless runtime/cgo is linked. Even with CGO_ENABLED=1, runtime/cgo is
// not pulled in unless `import "C"` is used somewhere. Goffi never uses
// `import "C"`, so we have to do the import here ourselves.
//
// This blank import is also what makes our //go:cgo_import_dynamic
// directives in dl_{linux,darwin,freebsd}.go effective under
// CGO_ENABLED=1: those directives are only honoured when the binary is
// linked with the external (cgo) linker, and the external linker is only
// activated when some package depends on runtime/cgo. The stdlib's `cgo`
// command achieves that by emitting an `import _ "runtime/cgo"` for every
// `import "C"` source file; we have to do it explicitly here because
// goffi itself contains no `import "C"`.
//
// In CGO_ENABLED=0 mode, this file is excluded and internal/fakecgo (kept
// in lockstep with this build tag via `//go:build !cgo`) supplies the
// equivalent runtime symbols, and the internal linker honours
// cgo_import_dynamic on its own.
